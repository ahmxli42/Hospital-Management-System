# Hospital-Management-System
This project is a basic Hospital Management System developed using Java and object-oriented programming concepts. It handles the management of patients, doctors, nurses, and hospital services in a simple and organized way. In this system, each patient has a unique ID, name, age, and illness, and medical records can be added for each patient. Patients can also schedule appointments with doctors. Doctors have their own ID, name, age, and area of specialization, and they can manage appointments and prescribe medication to patients. Nurses are also added with details like ID, name, age, and their assigned department, and they can assist doctors during medical procedures. The project includes two types of services: outpatient and inpatient. Outpatient services involve general checkups with a fee, while inpatient services include surgeries and longer treatments. Both services can be performed, and payments are processed for outpatient services. The system uses classes, objects, inheritance, and interfaces, showing how real-life hospital tasks can be handled using code. It is a helpful project to understand how object-oriented programming can be applied in real-world applications.
